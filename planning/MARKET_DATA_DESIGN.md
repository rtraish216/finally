# Market Data Backend — Design

Implementation-ready design for `backend/app/market/`, covering the unified data-source interface, the shared price cache, the GBM simulator, the Massive (Polygon.io) client, SSE streaming, and FastAPI lifecycle wiring.

**Status of this document relative to the codebase**: the market data subsystem is already built (see `planning/MARKET_DATA_SUMMARY.md`) and this design matches it closely. It differs from the current code in exactly two places, both called out explicitly below with a **`CHANGE NEEDED`** marker:

1. `PriceUpdate` / `PriceCache` are missing `session_start_price`, which `planning/API.md` requires in the SSE payload and the `GET /api/watchlist` response for computing daily change %.
2. `massive_client.py` reads `snap.last_trade.timestamp` (doesn't exist) instead of `snap.last_trade.sip_timestamp` (nanoseconds, not milliseconds) — a bug identified in `planning/MASSIVE_API.md` and flagged but not yet fixed in `planning/MARKET_INTERFACE.md`.

Everything else here documents the shipped design as-is.

                    └── MassiveDataSource     (Polygon.io REST poller — MASSIVE_API_KEY set)

```

Both data sources implement the same `MarketDataSource` ABC and are interchangeable — nothing downstream (SSE, portfolio, trades) knows or cares which one is active. `create_market_data_source()` picks one at startup based on `MASSIVE_API_KEY`. The `PriceCache` is the single point of truth: producers write to it on their own schedule (500ms for the simulator, 15s for Massive on a free-tier-safe interval), consumers read from it on theirs (500ms SSE cadence, on-demand for trades).

## 3. Data Model

**File: `backend/app/market/models.py`**

`PriceUpdate` is the only type that leaves the market data layer. Every downstream consumer — SSE, portfolio valuation, trade execution — works exclusively with it.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import time
from dataclasses import dataclass, field


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class PriceUpdate:
    """Immutable snapshot of a single ticker's price at a point in time."""

    ticker: str
    price: float
    previous_price: float
    session_start_price: float          # CHANGE NEEDED: new field
    timestamp: float = field(default_factory=time.time)  # Unix seconds

    @property
    def change(self) -> float:
        """Absolute tick-to-tick price change from the previous update."""
        return round(self.price - self.previous_price, 4)

    @property
    def change_percent(self) -> float:
        """Tick-to-tick percentage change from the previous update."""
        if self.previous_price == 0:
            return 0.0
        return round((self.price - self.previous_price) / self.previous_price * 100, 4)

    @property
    def direction(self) -> str:
        """'up', 'down', or 'flat' vs. the previous tick."""
        if self.price > self.previous_price:
            return "up"
        elif self.price < self.previous_price:
            return "down"
        return "flat"

    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        """Serialize for JSON / SSE transmission. Matches planning/API.md's SSE payload."""
        return {
            "ticker": self.ticker,
            "price": self.price,
            "previous_price": self.previous_price,
            "session_start_price": self.session_start_price,
            "timestamp": self.timestamp,
            "change": self.change,
            "change_percent": self.change_percent,
            "direction": self.direction,
        }
```

### Design decisions

- **`frozen=True, slots=True`**: immutable value objects, safe to share across async tasks without copying; `slots` trims memory since many are created per second.
- **`change`/`change_percent`/`direction` are tick-to-tick** (vs. `previous_price`), computed as properties so they can never drift out of sync with the two source fields.
- **`session_start_price` is separate from `previous_price`**: `previous_price` changes every tick; `session_start_price` is fixed for the lifetime of the process (or since the ticker was first tracked) and is what the frontend uses to compute **daily** change % per `PLAN.md` §6 — "Daily change % = (latest − start-of-session) / start-of-session, where start-of-session is the price when the app started."
- **`to_dict()`** is the single serialization point, used by both the SSE endpoint and any REST route that needs a JSON-safe price (e.g. `GET /api/watchlist`).

---

## 4. Price Cache

**File: `backend/app/market/cache.py`**

The cache is the central hub: data sources write, everything else reads. It's `threading.Lock`-protected (not `asyncio.Lock`) because the Massive client's synchronous `get_snapshot_all()` runs via `asyncio.to_thread()`, which is a real OS thread that `asyncio.Lock` would not protect against.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import time
from threading import Lock

from .models import PriceUpdate


class PriceCache:
    """Thread-safe in-memory cache of the latest price for each ticker.

    Writers: SimulatorDataSource or MassiveDataSource (one at a time).
    Readers: SSE streaming endpoint, portfolio valuation, trade execution.
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._prices: dict[str, PriceUpdate] = {}
        self._session_start: dict[str, float] = {}   # CHANGE NEEDED: new field
        self._lock = Lock()
        self._version: int = 0  # Monotonically increasing; bumped on every update

    def update(self, ticker: str, price: float, timestamp: float | None = None) -> PriceUpdate:
        """Record a new price for a ticker. Returns the created PriceUpdate.

        On the *first* update ever seen for a ticker, both previous_price and
        session_start_price are set to that first price (direction='flat', and
        session_start_price stays fixed at that value for every future update —
        it is never overwritten once set). This matches PLAN.md §6: session-start
        is "the price when the app started" for tickers present at startup, and
        "when first tracked" for tickers added later (there's no earlier price
        to use as a baseline).
        """
        with self._lock:
            ts = timestamp or time.time()
            prev = self._prices.get(ticker)
            previous_price = prev.price if prev else price

            session_start = self._session_start.get(ticker)
            if session_start is None:
                session_start = price
                self._session_start[ticker] = round(session_start, 2)

            update = PriceUpdate(
                ticker=ticker,
                price=round(price, 2),
                previous_price=round(previous_price, 2),
                session_start_price=self._session_start[ticker],
                timestamp=ts,
            )
            self._prices[ticker] = update
            self._version += 1
            return update

    def get(self, ticker: str) -> PriceUpdate | None:
        """Get the latest price for a single ticker, or None if unknown."""
        with self._lock:
            return self._prices.get(ticker)

    def get_all(self) -> dict[str, PriceUpdate]:
        """Snapshot of all current prices. Returns a shallow copy."""
        with self._lock:
            return dict(self._prices)

    def get_price(self, ticker: str) -> float | None:
        """Convenience: get just the price float, or None."""
        update = self.get(ticker)
        return update.price if update else None

    def remove(self, ticker: str) -> None:
        """Remove a ticker from the cache and forget its session-start baseline.

        Forgetting session_start means if the ticker is re-added later (e.g.
        removed from watchlist then re-added), it gets a fresh baseline at
        whatever the price is then — reasonable, since there's no continuous
        "session" for it in between.
        """
        with self._lock:
            self._prices.pop(ticker, None)
            self._session_start.pop(ticker, None)

    @property
    def version(self) -> int:
        """Current version counter. Useful for SSE change detection."""
        return self._version

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        with self._lock:
            return len(self._prices)

    def __contains__(self, ticker: str) -> bool:
        with self._lock:
            return ticker in self._prices
```

### Why a version counter?

The SSE loop polls the cache every ~500ms. Without a version counter it would re-serialize and re-send every ticker's price on every tick even when nothing changed (e.g. Massive only updates every 15s). The counter lets the loop skip a send when nothing is new:

```python
last_version = -1
while True:
    if price_cache.version != last_version:
        last_version = price_cache.version
        yield format_sse(price_cache.get_all())
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
```

---

## 5. Abstract Interface

**File: `backend/app/market/interface.py`** — unchanged from the current implementation.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class MarketDataSource(ABC):
    """Contract for market data providers.

    Implementations push price updates into a shared PriceCache on their own
    schedule. Downstream code never calls the data source directly for prices —
    it reads from the cache.

    Lifecycle:
        source = create_market_data_source(cache)
        await source.start(["AAPL", "GOOGL", ...])
        # ... app runs ...
        await source.add_ticker("TSLA")
        await source.remove_ticker("GOOGL")
        # ... app shutting down ...
        await source.stop()
    """

    @abstractmethod
    async def start(self, tickers: list[str]) -> None:
        """Begin producing price updates for the given tickers.

        Starts a background task that periodically writes to the PriceCache.
        Must be called exactly once. Calling start() twice is undefined behavior.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    async def stop(self) -> None:
        """Stop the background task and release resources.

        Safe to call multiple times. After stop(), the source will not write
        to the cache again.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    async def add_ticker(self, ticker: str) -> None:
        """Add a ticker to the active set. No-op if already present.

        The next update cycle will include this ticker.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    async def remove_ticker(self, ticker: str) -> None:
        """Remove a ticker from the active set. No-op if not present.

        Also removes the ticker from the PriceCache.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    def get_tickers(self) -> list[str]:
        """Return the current list of actively tracked tickers."""
```

Both implementations *push* to the cache rather than being polled for a price. This decouples timing entirely: the simulator ticks at 500ms, Massive polls at 15s, but SSE always reads the cache on its own 500ms cadence with no knowledge of which source is active.

---

## 6. Seed Prices & Parameters

**File: `backend/app/market/seed_prices.py`** — constants only, no logic, no imports beyond stdlib types. Shared by the simulator for initial prices and GBM parameters.

```python
"""Seed prices and per-ticker parameters for the market simulator."""

# Realistic starting prices for the default watchlist (per PLAN.md §7 seed data)
SEED_PRICES: dict[str, float] = {
    "AAPL": 190.00,
    "GOOGL": 175.00,
    "MSFT": 420.00,
    "AMZN": 185.00,
    "TSLA": 250.00,
    "NVDA": 800.00,
    "META": 500.00,
    "JPM": 195.00,
    "V": 280.00,
    "NFLX": 600.00,
}

# Per-ticker GBM parameters.
# sigma: annualized volatility (higher = more price movement)
# mu: annualized drift / expected return
TICKER_PARAMS: dict[str, dict[str, float]] = {
    "AAPL": {"sigma": 0.22, "mu": 0.05},
    "GOOGL": {"sigma": 0.25, "mu": 0.05},
    "MSFT": {"sigma": 0.20, "mu": 0.05},
    "AMZN": {"sigma": 0.28, "mu": 0.05},
    "TSLA": {"sigma": 0.50, "mu": 0.03},  # High volatility
    "NVDA": {"sigma": 0.40, "mu": 0.08},  # High volatility, strong drift
    "META": {"sigma": 0.30, "mu": 0.05},
    "JPM": {"sigma": 0.18, "mu": 0.04},   # Low volatility (bank)
    "V": {"sigma": 0.17, "mu": 0.04},     # Low volatility (payments)
    "NFLX": {"sigma": 0.35, "mu": 0.05},
}

# Default parameters for tickers not in the list above (dynamically added)
DEFAULT_PARAMS: dict[str, float] = {"sigma": 0.25, "mu": 0.05}

# Correlation groups for the simulator's Cholesky decomposition.
# Tickers in the same group have higher intra-group correlation.
CORRELATION_GROUPS: dict[str, set[str]] = {
    "tech": {"AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "META", "NVDA", "NFLX"},
    "finance": {"JPM", "V"},
}

# Correlation coefficients
INTRA_TECH_CORR = 0.6      # Tech stocks move together
INTRA_FINANCE_CORR = 0.5   # Finance stocks move together
CROSS_GROUP_CORR = 0.3     # Between sectors / unknown tickers
TSLA_CORR = 0.3            # TSLA does its own thing
```

Tickers added dynamically that aren't in `SEED_PRICES` start at a random price between $50–$300 (see `GBMSimulator._add_ticker_internal`), and get `DEFAULT_PARAMS`.

---

## 7. GBM Simulator

**File: `backend/app/market/simulator.py`**

Two classes: `GBMSimulator` (pure math, no async/I/O) wrapped by `SimulatorDataSource` (owns the asyncio loop, implements `MarketDataSource`, writes to `PriceCache`).

### 7.1 The math

Geometric Brownian Motion — the same model underlying Black-Scholes:

```
S(t+dt) = S(t) * exp((mu - sigma^2/2) * dt + sigma * sqrt(dt) * Z)
```

- `S(t)` = current price, `mu` = annualized drift, `sigma` = annualized volatility, `dt` = time step as a fraction of a trading year, `Z` = correlated standard normal draw.
- For 500ms ticks over 252 trading days × 6.5h/day: `dt = 0.5 / (252 × 6.5 × 3600) ≈ 8.48e-8`. This tiny `dt` keeps per-tick moves sub-cent while still accumulating into a realistic intraday range over a session.
- GBM is multiplicative (always `exp(...)`, always positive) — prices can never go negative, which is the main reason it's preferred over an additive random walk here.

### 7.2 Correlated moves

Real stocks co-move — independent draws per ticker would look visually wrong (nothing ever moves together). A **Cholesky decomposition** of a correlation matrix `C` (`L = cholesky(C)`) turns independent normal draws `Z_independent` into correlated draws `Z_correlated = L @ Z_independent`, each still marginally `N(0, 1)`.

Correlation structure: tech ~0.6 within group, finance ~0.5 within group, TSLA ~0.3 with everything (it does its own thing), everything else ~0.3 cross-sector default. The sector-grouped construction is always positive semi-definite, so `cholesky()` never fails for this fixed structure; if extended to arbitrary/user-supplied correlations later, validate PSD-ness before decomposing.

### 7.3 Random events

Each tick, each ticker has a ~0.1% chance of a sudden 2–5% move in either direction, for visual drama without dominating normal price action. With 10 tickers at 2 ticks/sec, expect a noticeable event roughly every ~50 seconds.

## 8. Massive API Client

**File: `backend/app/market/massive_client.py`**

Polls the Massive (formerly Polygon.io) REST snapshot endpoint for all watched tickers in a single call, on a configurable interval. The synchronous `RESTClient` runs in `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the event loop.

### 8.1 What must be fixed vs. the shipped code — `CHANGE NEEDED`

Per `planning/MASSIVE_API.md` (verified against the `massive-com/client-python` source), the `TickerSnapshot.last_trade` object has **no `.timestamp` field**. The trade time is `sip_timestamp`, and it is in **nanoseconds**, not milliseconds:

```python
# WRONG (current code, massive_client.py:101-103) — AttributeError at runtime
price = snap.last_trade.price
timestamp = snap.last_trade.timestamp / 1000.0

# CORRECT
price = snap.last_trade.price
timestamp = snap.last_trade.sip_timestamp / 1_000_000_000 if snap.last_trade.sip_timestamp else None
```

This has not caused a visible failure yet because the Massive path is dormant/untested against a live key (no `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is set in this project's `.env` — see `PLAN.md`'s decisions log), but it will raise `AttributeError` on every snapshot the moment a real key is configured, which the current `except (AttributeError, TypeError)` per-snapshot guard will silently swallow as a "skip" rather than actually reading any price. It must be fixed before the Massive path is exercised for real.

### 8.2 Corrected implementation

### 8.3 Choosing a poll interval

| Tier | Rate limit | Data freshness | Recommended poll interval |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic (free) | 5 req/min | End of day only | 15s (expect stale/EOD values regardless) |
| Starter / Developer | Unlimited | 15-min delayed | 2–5s |
| Advanced | Unlimited | Real-time | 1–2s |

A poll interval faster than the plan's actual data refresh rate just re-fetches the same value — it buys no freshness, only wastes requests. This project defaults to the 15s/Basic-tier-safe interval and treats the simulator as the realistic default; Massive is an opt-in upgrade path (`PLAN.md` §6).

### 8.4 Error handling philosophy

| Error | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Logged as error; poller keeps running (user might fix `.env` and restart). |
| 403 Forbidden | Logged as error; typically a free-tier key hitting the Snapshot endpoint, which requires Starter+. |
| 429 Rate limited | Logged as error; next poll retries after `poll_interval`. |
| Network timeout | Logged as error; retries automatically next cycle. |
| Malformed/missing snapshot fields | That ticker skipped with a warning; other tickers in the batch still processed. |
| All tickers fail | Cache retains last-known prices; SSE keeps streaming stale data (better than none). |

### 8.5 Lazy dependency

`massive` is declared as a core dependency in `pyproject.toml` (not lazily imported), so `uv sync` always installs it — this keeps the module importable and testable without special-casing, at the cost of requiring the package even for simulator-only use. This matches the current shipped code; if minimizing the simulator-only install footprint becomes a priority later, the import could move inside `start()` behind a `TYPE_CHECKING` guard, but that reopens the mock-patching friction called out in `planning/archive/MARKET_DATA_REVIEW.md` §3.2 (tests must target the module-level name to patch it) — not worth it for this project's scope.

    instantiate — it does not validate the key against Massive (that happens
    lazily on the first poll, so a bad or under-tiered key surfaces as a

The frontend side (per `PLAN.md` §10):

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/stream/prices');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const prices = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // prices: { "AAPL": { ticker, price, previous_price, session_start_price,
    //                      timestamp, change, change_percent, direction }, ... }
    // Daily change % = (price - session_start_price) / session_start_price * 100
};
```

### Why poll-and-push, not event-driven

The SSE loop polls the cache on a fixed interval rather than being notified by the data source. This is simpler and produces evenly-spaced updates, which matters because the frontend accumulates them into sparkline charts — regular spacing keeps those charts visually clean regardless of which data source is producing irregular (Massive) or regular (simulator) underlying updates.

---

## 11. FastAPI Lifecycle Integration

The market data system starts and stops with the app via FastAPI's `lifespan` context manager.

**In `backend/app/main.py`:**

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI

from app.market import PriceCache, create_market_data_source, create_stream_router
from app.market.interface import MarketDataSource


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # --- STARTUP ---
    price_cache = PriceCache()
    app.state.price_cache = price_cache

    source = create_market_data_source(price_cache)
    app.state.market_source = source

    initial_tickers = await load_watchlist_tickers()  # reads from SQLite, lazily initializing it
    await source.start(initial_tickers)

    stream_router = create_stream_router(price_cache)
    app.include_router(stream_router)

    yield  # app is running

    # --- SHUTDOWN ---
    await source.stop()


app = FastAPI(title="FinAlly", lifespan=lifespan)


def get_price_cache() -> PriceCache:
    return app.state.price_cache


def get_market_source() -> MarketDataSource:
    return app.state.market_source
```

### Accessing market data from other routes

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api")


@router.post("/portfolio/trade")
async def execute_trade(
    trade: TradeRequest,
    price_cache: PriceCache = Depends(get_price_cache),
):
    current_price = price_cache.get_price(trade.ticker)
    if current_price is None:
        raise HTTPException(400, f"Price not yet available for {trade.ticker}. Try again shortly.")
    # ... execute at current_price, recording a portfolio_snapshots row ...


@router.post("/watchlist")
async def add_to_watchlist(
    payload: WatchlistAdd,
    source: MarketDataSource = Depends(get_market_source),
):
    # ... insert into watchlist table ...
    await source.add_ticker(payload.ticker)
    # ...


@router.delete("/watchlist/{ticker}")
async def remove_from_watchlist(
    ticker: str,
    source: MarketDataSource = Depends(get_market_source),
):
    # ... delete from watchlist table ...
    # Only stop tracking if there's no open position — see §12.
    await source.remove_ticker(ticker)
    # ...
```

---

## 12. Watchlist Coordination

When the watchlist changes — via REST or LLM chat (`PLAN.md` §9's `watchlist_changes`) — the active `MarketDataSource` must be told, so it tracks the right ticker set. The SSE-streamed set per `PLAN.md` §6 is **watchlist ∪ open positions**, so portfolio value stays correct even if a held ticker is removed from the watchlist.

**Adding**: `POST /api/watchlist {ticker}` → insert into `watchlist` table → `await source.add_ticker(ticker)` (simulator: adds to `GBMSimulator`, rebuilds Cholesky, seeds cache immediately with a first price and thus a `session_start_price`; Massive: appended to the poll list, appears on the next cycle) → return success.

**Removing, with the open-position edge case**:

```python
@router.delete("/watchlist/{ticker}")
async def remove_from_watchlist(
    ticker: str,
    source: MarketDataSource = Depends(get_market_source),
):
    await db.delete_watchlist_entry(ticker)

    position = await db.get_position(ticker)
    if position is None or position.quantity == 0:
        await source.remove_ticker(ticker)
    # else: keep tracking — the position still needs live pricing for
    # portfolio valuation even though it's off the watchlist

    return {"ticker": ticker}
```

---

## 13. Testing Strategy

Matches `PLAN.md` §12's backend unit-test scope: simulator math validity, GBM interface conformance, and (for portfolio/trade code, outside this module) trade execution and P&L edge cases. The existing suite (`backend/tests/market/`, 73 tests, 84% coverage — see `planning/MARKET_DATA_SUMMARY.md`) already covers this; two additions are needed for the changes in this document:

### 13.1 `session_start_price` behavior

```python
class TestPriceCacheSessionStart:
    def test_session_start_set_on_first_update(self):
        cache = PriceCache()
        update = cache.update("AAPL", 190.00)
        assert update.session_start_price == 190.00

    def test_session_start_fixed_across_updates(self):
        cache = PriceCache()
        cache.update("AAPL", 190.00)
        cache.update("AAPL", 195.00)
        update = cache.update("AAPL", 180.00)
        # session_start_price never moves, unlike previous_price
        assert update.session_start_price == 190.00
        assert update.previous_price == 195.00

    def test_session_start_reset_after_remove_and_readd(self):
        cache = PriceCache()
        cache.update("AAPL", 190.00)
        cache.remove("AAPL")

### 13.2 Massive timestamp field fix

```python
def _make_snapshot(ticker: str, price: float, sip_timestamp_ns: int) -> MagicMock:
    snap = MagicMock()
    snap.ticker = ticker
    snap.last_trade.price = price
    snap.last_trade.sip_timestamp = sip_timestamp_ns
    return snap


async def test_poll_converts_nanosecond_timestamp(self):
    cache = PriceCache()
    source = MassiveDataSource(api_key="test-key", price_cache=cache, poll_interval=60.0)
    source._tickers = ["AAPL"]

    snap = _make_snapshot("AAPL", 190.50, sip_timestamp_ns=1_758_400_000_500_000_000)
    with patch.object(source, "_fetch_snapshots", return_value=[snap]):
        await source._poll_once()

    update = cache.get("AAPL")
    assert update.price == 190.50
    assert update.timestamp == pytest.approx(1_758_400_000.5)
```

The rest of the suite (simulator GBM math, price positivity, Cholesky rebuild on add/remove, cache version counter, factory selection, SSE change-detection) is unchanged from what's already shipped and documented in `planning/MARKET_DATA_SUMMARY.md`.

## 14. Configuration Summary

| Parameter | Location | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MASSIVE_API_KEY` | Environment variable | `""` (empty) | If set, use Massive API; otherwise use simulator |
| `update_interval` | `SimulatorDataSource.__init__` | `0.5`s | Time between simulator ticks |
| `poll_interval` | `MassiveDataSource.__init__` | `15.0`s | Time between Massive API polls (Basic-tier-safe) |
| `event_probability` | `GBMSimulator.__init__` | `0.001` | Chance of a random shock event per ticker per tick |
| `dt` | `GBMSimulator.__init__` | `~8.48e-8` | GBM time step (fraction of a trading year) |
| SSE push interval | `_generate_events()` | `0.5`s | Time between SSE cache-checks/pushes |
| SSE retry directive | `_generate_events()` | `1000`ms | Browser `EventSource` reconnection delay |

### Public API (`backend/app/market/__init__.py`)

```python
from .cache import PriceCache
from .factory import create_market_data_source
from .interface import MarketDataSource
from .models import PriceUpdate
from .stream import create_stream_router

__all__ = [
    "PriceUpdate",
    "PriceCache",
    "MarketDataSource",
    "create_market_data_source",
    "create_stream_router",
]
```

Usage for any downstream code:

```python
from app.market import PriceCache, create_market_data_source

cache = PriceCache()
source = create_market_data_source(cache)   # reads MASSIVE_API_KEY
await source.start(["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", ...])

update = cache.get("AAPL")            # PriceUpdate | None
price = cache.get_price("AAPL")       # float | None
all_prices = cache.get_all()          # dict[str, PriceUpdate]

await source.add_ticker("TSLA")
await source.remove_ticker("GOOGL")

await source.stop()
```
